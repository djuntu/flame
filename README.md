**Flame** is a lightweight command line interface which utilises object-like command building to point to individual
functions (subcommands). Flame can be installed and initialized with your other initialization scripts with no further
dependencies, making it a great addition to already established workplaces, and a fantastic starting point for new
projects in testing, production or admin usage.

**Features**
- Commands & subcommands displayed in a CLI format or directly accessed via script.
- Command realm (Client, Shared, Server) allowing for focused commands to be ran by specific sources.
- Clear autocomplete and simple and responsive GUI.
- Individual states for each command allowing versatile usage.
- Intuitive type building and suggestions allowing for validation, parsing, searching and transformation of your own types.
- Clear types meaning easy integration with module loaders.
- Smart middleware allowing for permissions and logging (Before and After execution).
- Clearly typed API and standardized logic flow for quick understanding for developers.
- Robust type validation and argument validation accompanied with an easy-to-use console for tech-savvy developers to non-scripter staff.
